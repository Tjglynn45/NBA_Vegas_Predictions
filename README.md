# NBA Vegas Predictions

Author: Theron Glynn

## Overview
This project applies machine learning classification to predict whether an NBA team will win the Las Vegas Spread
throughout the 2020-21 NBA season. The structure of our model will be based on inference. The model will focus on
the 'accuracy' metric as we are aiming to maximize true positives and true negatives.

## Business Problem
Las Vegas makes millions of dollars daily from NBA sports betting per season. Bettors place bets on teams based on
factors such as favorite teams, the favorite in the matchup and other factors. In order to maximize earning potential
as a bettor , understanding what goes into a spread would possibly help choose what bets to take and to possibly leave
alone. 

## Data
My team and Game data came from a kaggle dataset with gamelogs from 2014-2021. I formatted the dataset to the 2020-21
NBA season. My Vegas Spread dataset was found on sportsbookwebsite in a excel format. I formatted the dataset to include
opening and closing spreads as well as if the spread was met. 

My Final Data was game data leading up each game with the home and away team last 5 points, rebounds, assist,free throw,
3pt pct averages as well as defensive team stats. For each teams first 5 games ,I decided to use the average of each team 
for the year as that is an accumulation of the total season which is the best metric for an overall picture of a teams 
performance.

## Modeling Process & Results
After EDA and feature engineer I decided to start my modeling. I employed a number of different models . I compe

## Conclusion



## Next Steps
There is more work to improve my model. In the future I hope to include the following:
* Implement more NBA seasons as well as pull in more categorical data such as Teams win/loss records, Player stats
* Look at season trends; were there changes to how a spread is predicted on specific teams
*
